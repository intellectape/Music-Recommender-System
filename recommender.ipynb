    "# Music Recommender System using Apache Spark and Python\n",
    "**Estimated time: 8hrs**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you are to create a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix). \n",
    "\n",
    "To create this system you will be using Spark and the collaborative filtering technique. The instructions for completing this project will be laid out entirely in this file. You will have to implement any missing code as well as answer any questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission Instructions:** \n",
    "* Add all of your updates to this IPython file and do not clear any of the output you get from running your code.\n",
    "* Upload this file onto moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using some publicly available song data from audioscrobbler, which can be found [here](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~bergstrj/audioscrobbler_data.html). However, we modified the original data files so that the code will run in a reasonable time on a single machine. The reduced data files have been suffixed with `_small.txt` and contains only the information relevant to the top 50 most prolific users (highest artist play counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data file `user_artist_data.txt` contained about 141,000 unique users, and 1.6 million unique artists. About 24.2 million usersâ€™ plays of artists are recorded, along with their count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when plays are scribbled, the client application submits the name of the artist being played. This name could be misspelled or nonstandard, and this may only be detected later. For example, \"The Smiths\", \"Smiths, The\", and \"the smiths\" may appear as distinct artist IDs in the data set, even though they clearly refer to the same artist. So, the data set includes `artist_alias.txt`, which maps artist IDs that are known misspellings or variants to the canonical ID of that artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `artist_data.txt` file then provides a map from the canonical artist ID to the name of the artist."

You can read more information about this from the collaborative filtering page: [http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html). The [function you will be using](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.recommendation.ALS.trainImplicit) has a few tunable parameters that will affect how the model is built. Therefore, to get the best model, we will do a small parameter sweep and choose the model that performs the best on the validation set\n",

Once we have a method for evaluation, we can run a parameter sweep, evaluate each combination of parameters on the validation data, and choose the optimal set of parameters.

This model can be used to predict the top X artist recommendations for a user and these recommendations can be compared the artists that the user actually listened to (here, X will be the number of artists in the dataset of *true* artist plays). Then, the fraction of overlap between the top X predictions of the model and the X artists that the user actually listened to can be calculated. This process can be repeated for all users and an average value returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a model predicted [1,2,4,8] as the top X=4 artists for a user. Suppose, that user actually listened to the artists [1,3,7,8]. Then, for this user, the model would have a score of 2/4=0.5. To get the overall score, this would be performed for all users, with the average returned.\n",
